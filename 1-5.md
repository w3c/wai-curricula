#### Homework Ideas

* Provide students with a multiple choice quiz in which they want to select all of the accessibility planning and managing strategies they consider important for their organization or workflow. Encourage them to elaborate on how they would integrate new accessibility strategies they might not know about before.
* Ask students to list various roles in charge of accessibility among the team and which would be their main responsibilities.
* Ask students to pick up a product or service of their choice and to develop strategies to efficiently plan and manage accessibility. Encourage them to think about key roles and responsibilities as well as key actions that need to be taken to grant accessibility is maintained throughout time.

#### Teaching Ideas

* If possible, bring in some examples of accessibility policies you are aware of or may have access to. Explain that they serve to document organizational commitments, to encourage implementation, and to define monitor and review processes. If you cannot bring such a document, refer to the [Accessibility Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies) resource, and walk students through the different elements that are needed for a consistent accessibility policy.
* Ask students to explore publicly available accessibility statements and encourage them to reflect on some of the aspects they include.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to draft an accessibility policy based on a particular organization of their choice. Ask them to define the scope of the policy, to reference current standards and to set compliance levels. Use the [Accessibility Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies) resource as a reference.
* Ask students to draft an accessibility statement considering a particular product of their choice. Show the [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/) resource as a reference for this exercise.

* Explain the different types of roles involved in implementing web accessibility. Use the [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document) resource as a reference.
* Introduce the scope of their responsibilities throughout. Emphasize that sometimes a particular accessibility feature needs involvement from several roles.
* Go through the [Role-Based Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role-Based_Decision_Tree) resource to help students identify the specific role within the team who would be in charge of a particular accessibility feature. Ask students to decide if there would be only one role involved or if the primary owner might require help from other team members.

#### Homework Ideas

* Based on the [Role-Based Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role-Based_Decision_Tree) resource, ask students to pick up specific features of products they may be working on. Encourage them to assign their corresponding roles and responsibilities. For instance, if an alternative text is required for an image, who would provide that text? Who would implement it?
