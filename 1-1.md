{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Stories of People with Disabilities

Introduce real stories of how people with disabilities interact with web pages and applications. If you can, invite people with disabilities to show which specific tools they use. This live interaction may allow students to ask questions. If you cannot bring tangible people, then use resources such as [Web Accessibility Perspectives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/) videos and [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/), which provide realistic examples.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Describe how some individuals with disabilities use the Web
* Enumerate some design features that benefit people with disabilities
* Enumerate some of the major design barriers that exclude people with disabilities
* Recognize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design

{% comment %}

#### Duration.

Approximately 1-2 hours depending on demonstrations and activities.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Invite expert users with disabilities to show the assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use when interacting with websites and applications. Ask users to explain some accessibility features. Encourage them to present some frequently encountered barriers and strategies they use to work around them.
* Coach students in trying out assistive technologies and adaptive strategies by themselves. For example, invite them to follow advanced users and experiment with text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones. Ask students to reflect on their experiences.
* Relate the experiences of how people with disabilities browse the Web to design accessibility features, barriers, and the functionality of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. The resource [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/) explains such relationships.

Tip: As you may be inviting only one or two users, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and use an inclusive approach. Refer to the resource [Interacting with People with Disabilities](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html) for info on avoiding clichés and myths.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.
* Ask students to research more about a particular type of disability or an assistive technology they are interested in. Encourage them to elaborate on the innovation, potential, and broader benefits of accessibility features.
* Introduce popular people with disabilities, such as Frida Kahlo, Stephen Hawking, or Stevie Wonder. Ask students to research about how technology helped them achieve their successes.

### Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility

Introduce the definition and scope of web accessibility. Present common terminology using the [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) resource.  
Explain the overlaps between accessibility and usability. Emphasize how accessibility fits into design practices such as inclusive design. Use the [Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/) resource.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Define web accessibility for people with disabilities
* Identify the relevance of web accessibility in a growing number of devices and contexts
* Explain key terms in the context of web accessibility
* Compare accessibility, usability, and inclusion, and describe some of the overlaps between them
* Identify the social dimension of accessibility to include people with disabilities

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Define web accessibility as the ability for people with disabilities to use web content, tools, and technology equally.
* Guide students through a reflection on the relevance of web accessibility. Focus on the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.). Emphasize that accessibility favors social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc.). Encourage students to participate, especially if they have had any previous exposure to accessibility.
* Engage students in a conversation about the relationship between accessibility for people with disabilities and other people they know: older people, people not fluent in a language, people new to technology or with lower digital skills, and others.
* Explain that accessibility is part of overall inclusion, since accessibility features benefit all users as well as those with disabilities.
* Define usability as the discipline in charge of designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Explain that accessibility is needed to cover those aspects from the perspective of people with disabilities.
* Introduce examples of accessibility in urban environments, buildings, transportation, etc. Explain how these relate to the digital context. Use ramps and high-contrast features to illustrate how accessibility characteristics are also beneficial for all users.
* Refer to accessibility as a social right for people with disabilities under the United Nations [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) (UN CRPD).

Tip: This topic sets the tone for future topics on the components of web accessibility, its business case, the applicable standards, and some planning and managing strategies. To prepare students for this further knowledge, emphasize that accessibility focuses primarily on the usability for people with disabilities and describe how accessibility characteristics benefit all users, e.g., mobile device users or users not fluent in the language.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to collect information on accessibility features in buildings, transportation, education, healthcare or any other aspect of their daily life. Encourage them to draw analogies with web accessibility and to think about some characteristics that digital products may have to ensure they are accessible for all.
* Ask students to select a technology device (e.g., computer, smartphone, smartwatch, television, etc.) and learn about the accessibility features and settings that are available on the device. Select a type of disability and determine which features and settings on that device would help remove barriers for people with that disability type. Have students describe which features and settings they would benefit from using even if they do not have a disability, and why.

## Ideas for Assessment

* Students should be able to communicate that everybody, regardless of their disability, can use technology equally when it is accessible. They should explain that barriers are not caused by disabilities but by decisions taken at any stage of the project.
* Learners should be able to define web accessibility as well as some related terms such as usability and inclusion.
* Learners should be able to explain that web accessibility plays a fundamental role in other technologies beyond web pages and applications.
* Learners should be able to describe some of the most important barriers preventing people with disabilities from accessing technology.
