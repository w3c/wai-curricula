### Topic: Social Benefits

The archived resource Social Factors in Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization [^2] contains some of the social factors for an accessibility business case. Explain how accessibility features benefit all users: older people, people using mobile devices, people with lower digital skills, people who are not fluent in a language, etc. Emphasize the benefits that accessibility brings to the business brand, especially through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs.  

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

* Recognize accessibility as an essential discipline for equal opportunity
* Explain that accessibility also benefits users without disabilities
* Explain how accessibility can enhance the brand perception and contribute to some other benefits related to CSR
* Identify accessibility as an essential requirement due to the increasing relevance of the digital world at all levels of interaction

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30 to 45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Refer to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) as a resource where students can find access to information as a fundamental right of people with disabilities. Link this reference to the corresponding international, regional, and local policies that apply in your zone. 
* Discuss how accessibility solutions are also enjoyed by many people regardless of their disability. Emphasize how many solutions originally thought for accessibility have become mainstream, such as text-to-speech or speech recognition.
* Promote discussion among students about which aspects of accessibility benefit them. For instance, ask them which products they can use without looking at or without pressing any button on them.
* Encourage students to research for publicly available testimonials about business cases for accessibility. Advise them that accuracy of such testimonials might not be easily determined and further research might be needed.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to research on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Encourage them to share with their colleagues the conception that it offers about people with disabilities. Concentrate on their right to access to information found in article 9.
* Ask students to research how many people with disabilities might be benefited by accessibility in their organization or local environment. Emphasize that statistics on this matter are difficult to find and interpret. The concept of disability, the way it is measured in different cultures, and the right for people not to disclose their disabilities may influence the results.
* Ask studetns to perform a specific task with their smart asisstant built-in to their mobile phones. Point students to general questions such as asking for the news, querying how the weather is like, or checking how many items they have in their shopping list.

## Ideas for Assessment

* Learners should be able to explain different business case arguments for digital accessibility, and broader benefits of accessibility for people in different situations and contexts.
* Learners should be able to develop potential business case arguments for their own organization, and present this to other learners as examples of how they can apply what they have learned.
