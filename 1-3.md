* Promote discussion among students about which aspects of accessibility benefit them. For instance, ask them if they use any smart assistant or a smart speaker.
* Encourage students to research for publicly available testimonials about business cases for accessibility.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to research on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Encourage them to share with their colleagues the conception that it offers about people with disabilities. Concentrate on their right to access to information found in article 9.
* Ask students to research how many people with disabilities might be benefited  by accessibility. Emphasize that statistics on this matter are difficult to find, so encourage them to give a picture from their local or organizational perspective.
* Ask studetns to perform a specific task with their smart asisstant built-in to their mobile phones. Point  students to general questions such as asking for the news, or how the weather is like.
