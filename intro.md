    <li><strong>Stories of people with disabilities</strong> &mdash; Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use the Web. Highlight the diversity of people with disabilities, trying to avoid as much as possible the medical model approach as well as some frequently encountered cliches, . Instead, concentrate  on how they use the Web. Emphasize how design and implementation cause barriers as opposed to barriers being inherent to the user (social model of disability).</li>
    <li><strong>Diverse abilities, tools, and barriers</strong> &mdash; Introduce examples of specific types of disabilities, including people with auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Introduce some of the design and implementation barriers that people encounter. Relate some of these barriers to personal experiences in using the Web, such as being overwhelmed by the content or confused by the navigation etc. Emphasize how every individual is unique.</li>
    <li><strong>Assistive tools and adaptive strategies</strong> &mdash; Provide an opportunity for learners to experience some types of assistive tools, such as a screen reader, and adaptive strategies, such as changing fonts and colors. Demonstrate use by experienced users of access technology, to avoid misunderstanding of the tools (assistive tools can be very complex and not intended for casual use). Encourage learners to explore different settings in web browsers and operating systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Principles of universal design</strong> &mdash; Explain the overlapping accessibility needs of different users, such as "reading aloud" functionality benefiting people not seeing the screen and people with some forms of dyslexia. Explain that people could have combinations of disabilities, such as auditory and visual disabilities, especially with growing age. In particular, emphasize the FACT THAT people have very individual combinations of accessibility needs and preferences.</li>
  </ul></dd>

    <li><strong>Demonstrations</strong> &mdash; Learners should be able to demonstrate what they have learned from exploring assistive tools and adaptive strategies, such as explaining different settings they found in their web browser.</li>
  </ul></dd>
  <dt><strong>Notes</strong></dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li><strong>Ethical considerations</strong> &mdash; Consider the appropriate ethical aspects when working with people (also when showing videos of people); for example, ensure consent, provide compensation, and avoid patronizing behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Cliches and myths</strong> &mdash; Unfortunately there are cliches, myths, and even stigmatization of people with disabilities, which could be unintentionally reinforced with caution. Experienced instructors are recommended.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural aspects</strong> &mdash; The definition of disability and the approach to accessibility varies between different cultures. This can impact the initial level of awareness and acceptance for the topic by learners.</li>

    <li>Knowledge of how they are developed and their adoption by businesses internationally</li>
    <li>Understanding the terms Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR)</li>
    <li>Awareness of different design and development guidelines, and examples for each</li>
    <li>Ability to carry out preliminary evaluation of simple web pages for accessibility</li>
  </ul></dd>
  <dt><strong>Prerequisites for Learners</strong></dt>
  <dd>[Basic] Basic understanding of computers and the Web.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Prerequisites for instructors</strong></dt>
  <dd>[Medium] Good understanding of the W3C accessibility standards and guidelines, and knowledge of how to check potential accessibility barriers.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Approximate Duration</strong></dt>
  <dd>2-4 hours depending on activities.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Teaching Outline</strong></dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li><strong>Components of web accessibility</strong> &mdash; Revise the inter-relationship between accessibility features in web technologies such as HTML, in web content, web authoring tools, web browsers, and assistive tools, which were introduced in the first teaching unit of this module. Relate this back to more specific examples for the second teaching module and highlight the broader benefits of these examples. Reiterate that accessibility encompasses many types of roles and responsibilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong> &mdash; Introduce the scope of "web content" in WCAG, which includes desktop and mobile websites and applications. Highlight that there are currently two operational versions, 2.0 and 2.1, with 2.0 being a subset of 2.1 that provides improvements for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, people with low vision, and people with disabilities using mobile devices. Refer to the uptake of WCAG in different policies and standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</strong> &mdash; Introduce the scope of "authoring tools" in ATAG, which include diverse content production tools including text and graphic based code editing tools, content management systems (CMS), conversion tools, and social media platforms.

    <li><strong>User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)</strong> &mdash; Introduce the scope of "user agents" in UAAG, which include diverse applications including web browsers, web-based media players, and some types of assistive tools and mobile applications that allow users to access and interact with web content. Emphasize the relevance of user agents, which are key to supporting accessibility features in web technologies and content; lack of accessibility support is a primary barrier.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)</strong> &mdash; Explain that this accessibility standard does not define accessibility requirements but rather provides a mechanism for authors to embed semantics in web content, to facolitate interoperability with assistive tools. Emphasize that many of these semantics are meanwhile integrated directly in HTML5, which should be used natively whenever possible. WAI-ARIA can also be used with other technologies, such as SVG.</li>
    <li><strong>Open standards development</strong> &mdash; Explain that these W3C accessibility standards and guidelines are developed following an open consensus process, with involvement of representation of people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, research, and individual experts. W3C Working Groups publish working drafts periodically for comments from the public. Everyone is encouraged to comments, to help include many perspectives thus ensure broad consensus around these standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Web accessibility principles</strong> &mdash; Explain the terms Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR) based on how they are defined in WCAG. Introduce the Guidelines defined by WCAG for each of these terms, and provide specific examples to help explain the meaning and relevance of each. For example, provide a specific example of the Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable. Emphasize how such requirements are essential for people with disabilities and benefit all.</li>
    <li><strong>First checks for web accessibility principles</strong> &mdash; Guide learners through preliminary checks for web accessibility on simple web pages; for example, to identify page headings and their relative order, use by keyboard and other indicative checks (not full conformance evaluation, which requires technical skills and further accessibility knowledge). Ask learners to explore different types of websites and relate their finds to the accessibility principles and guidelines.</li>
  </ul></dd>
