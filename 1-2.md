## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This unit builds on the previous unit “What is Web Accessibility.” The aims of this unit are to:

* study the interdependencies between components of web accessibility (web browsers, authoring tools, web designers and developers, and more)

## Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Recognize the broad diversity of people with disabilities
* List different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies
* Recognize the impact of design decisions on accessibility for people
* Explain some of the interdependencies between components of web accessibility

## Competences

The following is a list of skills required for this unit.

Learners

### Topic: Diverse Abilities, Tools, and Strategies

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

Introduce the wide range of people with disabilities, including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Explain the variety of abilities, needs, and preferences, even among people with the same type of disability. Examples are provided in the resource [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* List types of abilities and related accessibility needs
* Differentiate between assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, and list some of them
* Describe some accessibility design features and barriers

#### Teaching Ideas

* Ask students to engage with people with disabilities, such as relatives, friends, or colleagues. Ask students to gather information on the assistive tools and/or adaptive strategies their acquaintances use to interact with digital technology. Help students classify the tools they learn about.
* Guide students to focus on the abilities of people with disabilities and on how technology is part of their everyday life. Coach students towards thinking about people first and promote an inclusive approach. Use the resource [Interacting with People with Disabilities](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html) for further information. 
* Present some assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, such as captions, text customization (e.g., font size, color, spacing), specialized keyboards, audio descriptions, screen readers, and screen magnifiers. Mention things like eye glasses are also a type of assistive device.
* Demonstrate use of assistive technology by experienced users. Note that some tools are complex and not easy for novices to use. Ask demonstrators to show examples of accessible content first, then inaccessible content.
* Encourage learners to try some adaptive strategies following expert advice by exploring different settings in web browsers and operating systems.
* Discuss with students various accessibility design features of common sites or devices, as well as access barriers that people experience with digital content. Help them understand the everyday impact of design decisions on people with disabilities.

**Important**: Avoid portraying disabilities as being limiting or uncomfortable. For information on avoiding clichés and myths, see [Interacting with People with Disabilities {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html).

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to explore the use of assistive technologies to perform a task, such as reading the news, making a purchase, or interacting in social networks. Make it clear that their experiences are not the same as a person who regularly uses the assistive technology and is likely much more skilled with it.
* Ask students to go to three different types of websites (e.g., shopping site, banking site, or entertainment site) and identify three access barriers from each of the three sites. Ask students to creatively explain how better design can remove those barriers found.
* Ask students to contact a person with a disability and interview them about what accessibility barriers they encounter when trying to access digital content or applications. Have students write up a summary of the interview and share with others in class.

### Topic: Components of Web Accessibility

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

Explain that web accessibility depends on several components working together &mdash; content, browsers, authoring tools, web designers and developers, and more. Briefly note that there areW3C Standards for the different components. (The standards are explored in detail in Unit 4.) For an explanation of the components and interdependencies, see the resource [Essential Components of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/).

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Describe the components that contribute to accessibility
* Explain some of the interdependencies between the components
* Differentiate the interdependencies between digital accessibility, content technologies, and tools
* Identify W3C standards that address the components

#### Teaching Ideas

* Based on the previously taught topics, ask students to reflect on the interdependencies between assistive technologies, adaptive strategies, and digital content. Guide them to realize how one relies on the other and how using different combinations of tools may yield different user experiences.
* Explore with students some of the accessibility features built into content technologies, such as HTML; for example, headings and lists. Ask students to reflect on how these relate to prior observations they made.
* Ask students to reflect on the roles of browsers and media players; for example, if a media player does not support captions or audio descriptions. Encourage them to explore accessibility support in different tools.
* Ask students to reflect on the role of authoring tools, such as Content Management Systems (CMS). For example, does their preferred social media platform include options to provide text alternatives for images?
* Encourage students to think about potential options to improve accessibility in different situations. Guide them to reflect on the implications of using a more accessible browser, exploring plug-ins for tools, and requiring accessibility during procurement.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to reflect on specific types of accessibility features and barriers, and how they relate to the different components of web accessibility.
* Ask students to choose one type of accessibility feature in content technology and identify 3 websites where it is being used effectively. For example: Where are ordered and unordered lists used effectively? Where is heading structure in place?
* Provide students with a list of 10 - 15 accessibility barriers and ask them to decide for each of them if they should be addressed by the content, the underlying technology, the user agent, and/or assistive technology.
* Provide students with a list of websites and ask them to use them with three different browsers and assistive technologies. Ask them to explain any differences between accessing the content with the different browsers and assistive technologies. Encourage them to make a decision as to which browser works best and why.

## Ideas for Assessment

* Learners should be able to explain different types of accessibility features, such as colors with good contrast, types of barriers, and types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies.  
**Note**: Emphasize how accessibility is about enhancing the ability of people to use technology.
* Learners should be able to demonstrate what they have learned from exploring assistive tools and adaptive strategies, such as explaining different settings they found in their web browser.
* Learners should be able to describe how some adaptive strategies and assistive tools may benefit other users as well, such as aging individuals.
* Learners should be able to describe some of the components of web accessibility.

## Notes

* **Ethical considerations** &mdash; Consider the ethical aspects of working with people (also when showing videos of people); for example, ensure consent, provide compensation, and avoid patronizing behavior.
* **Clichés and myths** &mdash; Unfortunately there are negative clichés, myths, and even stigmatization of people with disabilities, which could be unintentionally reinforced. Make sure the instructor is aware of these issues and avoids them.
* **Cultural aspects** &mdash; The definition of disability and the approach to accessibility varies between different cultures. This can impact the initial level of awareness and acceptance for the topic by learners.
