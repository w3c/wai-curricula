## Introduction

This unit builds on the previous unit “What is Web Accessibility.” It explores assistive technologies, adaptive strategies, and accessible design principles in more detail. Students will also consider the inter-dependencies between these components.

## Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Recognize the broad diversity of people with disabilities
* List different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies
* Recognize the impact of design decisions on accessibility for people
* Explain some of the inter-dependencies between components of web accessibility

## Competences

***Learners***

### Topic: Diverse Abilities, Tools, and Strategies

Introduce the wide range of people with disabilities. Explain the great variety of abilities, needs, and preferences within different groups. Consider various needs of those with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. The resource [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/) provides examples of these.

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Identify diverse types of abilities and related accessibility needs
* Differentiate between assistive technologies and adaptive strategies and list some of them
* Describe some related accessibility design features and barriers

#### Duration

Approximately 2-3 hours depending on demonstrations, interaction, and activities.

#### Teaching Ideas

* Ask students to engage with relatives, friends, or colleagues with disabilities that they may have. Ask students to gather information on which types of assistive tools and/or adaptive strategies their acquaintances use to interact with digital technology. Help students clasify the tools they have learned about.
* Guide students to focus on the abilities of people with disabilities and on how technology is part of their every day life. Coach students towards thinking about people first and promote an inclusive approach. Use the resource [Interacting with People with Disabilities](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html) for further information. 
* Present some assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, such as captions, text customization (eg. font size, color, spacing, etc.), specialized keyboards, audio descriptions, screen readers, and screen magnifiers.
* Demonstrate use of assistive technology by experienced users, to avoid misunderstanding (these tools can be complex and not intended for casual use). Ask them to show the difference between accessible and inaccessible content.
* Encourage learners to try some adaptive strategies following expert advise by exploring different settings in web browsers and operating systems.
* Discuss with students various accessibility design features of common sites or devices, as well as access barriers that people experience with digital content. Help them understand the every day impact of design decisions on people with disabilities.

**Tip**: While it is important to introduce different types of disabilities, avoid portraying them as being limiting or discomfortable. Communicate that barriers are caused by design decisions rather than by the disability.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to explore the use of assistive technologies to perform a task, such as reading the news, making a purchase, interacting in social networks, etc. Instruct them that their experiences are not those of an assistive technology everyday user.
* Ask students to go to three different types of websites (e.g., shopping site, banking site, entertainment site) and to identify three access barriers from each of the three sites. Ask students to creatively explain how better design may remove those barriers found.
* Ask students to contact a person with a disability and interview them about what access barriers they encounter when trying to access digital content or applications. Students will write up a summary of the interview and share with other students in class.

### Topic: Components of Web Accessibility

Explain that web accessibility involves inter-dependent components, such as content, browsers, and authoring tools. Each of them have their own responsibilities for the overall accessible user experience. Introduce the web accessibility standards from W3C and explain how they address accessibility in different components. The resource [Essential Components of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/) explains these components and their inter-dependencies.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Identify some of the inter-dependencies between components for accessibility
* Differentiate the inter-dependencies between digital accessibility, content technologies, and tools
* Describe how each of these components contribute to accessibility
* Explain the existence of W3C standards referring to different components of web accessibility

#### Teaching Ideas

* Based on the previously taught topics, ask students to reflect on the inter-dependencies between assistive technologies, adaptive strategies, and digital content. Guide them to realize how one relies on the other.
* Explore with students some of the accessibility features built into content technologies, such as HTML; for example headings and lists. Ask students to reflect on how these relate to prior observations they made.
* Ask students to reflect on the roles of browsers and media players; for example if a media player does not support captions or audio descriptions. Encourage them to explore accessibility support in different tools.
* Ask students to reflect on the role of authoring tools, such as Content Management Systems (CMS). For example, does their preferred social media platform include options to provide text alternatives for images?
* Encourage students to think about potential options to improve accessibility in different situations. Guide them to reflect on the implications of using a more accessibility-friendly browser, exploring plug-ins for tools, and requiring accessibility during procurement.

#### Homework Ideas

* Ask students to reflect on specific types of accessibility features and barriers, and how they relate to the different components of web accessibility.
* Ask students to choose one type of accessibility feature in content technology and identify 3 websites where it is being used effectively. For example: Where are ordered and unordered lists used effectively? Where is heading structure in place?
* Provide students with a list of 10 - 15 accessibility barriers and ask them to decide for each of them if they should be addressed by paying attention to the digital content, the technology, or the tool in use.
* Provide students with a set of websites of your choice and ask them to use them with three different browsers and assistive technologies. Ask them to explain any differences between accessing the content with the different browsers and assistive technologies. Encourage them to make a decision as to which browser works best and why.

## Ideas for Assessment

* Learners should be able to explain different types of accessibility features, such as colors with good contrast, types of barriers, and types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies.  
*(Note: Emphasize how accessibility is about enhancing the ability of people to use technology*.
* Learners should be able to demonstrate what they have learned from exploring assistive tools and adaptive strategies, such as explaining different settings they found in their web browser.
* Learners should be able to describe how some adaptive strategies and assistive tools may benefit other users as well, such as aging individuals.
* Learners should be able to describe some of the components of web accessibility.

## Notes

* **Ethical considerations** &mdash; Consider the appropriate ethical aspects when working with people (also when showing videos of people); for example, ensure consent, provide compensation, and avoid patronizing behavior.
* **clichés and myths** &mdash; Unfortunately there are clichés, myths, and even stigmatization of people with disabilities, which could be unintentionally reinforced. Experienced instructors are recommended.
* **Cultural aspects** &mdash; The definition of disability and the approach to accessibility varies between different cultures. This can impact the initial level of awareness and acceptance for the topic by learners.
