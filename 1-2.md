## Suggested Teaching Outline

The objective of this unit is to raise the awareness of students on the wide range of abilities and technologies that people use to interact with the Web, and to provide them with an understanding of assistive technologies, adaptive strategies, and how these relates to design features. It consists of the following lessons:
* Stories of people with disabilities: demonstrates real examples of people with disabilities using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web.
* Diverse abilities, tools and barriers: introduces a broad variety of examples of different types of disabilities, including people with auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.
* Assistive tools and adaptive strategies: provides more in-depth explanation of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, and an opportunity for students to get more acquainted with some of them.
* Lesson 4 "Principles of inclusive design": explains the basic principles of inclusive design, to address people with different accessibility needs, temporary and situational limitations, and other benefits.

**Note**: This is a suggested teaching outline to help achieve the learning outcomes. Instructors might choose to adapt the sequence of the lessons or their content according to the particular audience and context.

### Lesson 1: Stories of people with disabilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Provide tangible examples of people with disabilities using the Web. If possible, invite real users to demonstrate how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact with the Web. If it is not possible to bring in real people with disabilities, consider using video recordings. If video cannot be used either, use images and story-telling techniques to help illustrate realistic personas and user stories, such as those provided in the teaching materials.

As you may only have time for one or two examples, make sure to emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even with the same type of disability. Also emphasize how design features can enable or disable people. That is, emphasize the social model of disability and avoid using a medical approach. Avoid frequently encountered clichés and myths. Complement the few examples that you cover in-depth with some examples of people with other types of disabilities.

**Tip:** Commonly it is helpful to show examples of people using accessible content first, so that students realize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.

**Note:** Later lessons will introduce different types of disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies in more depth. This lesson is primarily intended for firsthand experience of real people, which is often first encounter for students.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding how some individuals with disabilities use the Web.
* Appreciating the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design.
* Gaining empathy, inspiration, and motivation for the topic.

1-2 hours, depending on demonstrations and activities.

{% endcomment %}

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* **Demonstrations**: Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies - this is often the first encounter for students to observe real use of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies.
* **Conversational**: Invite people with disabilities for a discussion on their daily experience while using the Web - this is often the first opportunity for students to engage with people with disabilities and to build more empathy.
* **Experiential**: Ask students to try out using assistive technologies as demonstrated by experienced users - this can be a fun way to get an understanding and appreciations for different ways of interacting with the Web.

#### Suggested activities 

Ask students to try and follow along an experienced user using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For example, using text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to reflect on their observations, for example in a short essay (200-300 words). Students should explain some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function.

### Lesson 2: Diverse abilities, tools, and barriers
 
{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 
 
Introduce examples of specific types of disabilities, including people with auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Introduce some of the design and implementation barriers that people encounter. Relate some of these barriers to personal experiences in using the Web, such as being overwhelmed by the content or confused by the navigation etc. Emphasize how every individual is unique.

**Tip**: As this lesson might become too medical at a first approach, focus on the fact that barriers are not caused by the disability itself but, instead, by bad implementations at a software or product level.

#### Learning outcomes

* Knowledge about the different types of disabilities.
* Awareness on the most common implementation barriers.
* Knowledge about how to relate such barriers with personal experiences of people with disabilities.

{% endcomment %}

#### Suggested teaching methods

**Presentational**: - Provide a description on the types of disabilities that exist. Emphasize how these types of disabilities are not limiting but, on the contrary, can raise other capabilities of the person.

#### Suggested activities

Engage students in a conversation about the different types of disabilities and common barriers that they have been learning about. Promote that they relate each of the barriers with the type (or types) of disabilities that this barrier affects.

#### Suggested homework

Ask students to write some lines about the most common types of disabilities: auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual, emphasizing the fact that they can use the web just as everybody else.

### Lesson 3: Assistive tools and adaptive strategies

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

Provide an opportunity for learners to experience some types of assistive tools, such as a screen reader, and adaptive strategies, such as changing fonts and colors. Demonstrate use by experienced users of access technology, to avoid misunderstanding of the tools (assistive tools can be very complex and not intended for casual use). Encourage learners to explore different settings in web browsers and operating systems.

#### Learning outcomes

* Understanding how an assistive technology works and how it renders information to the user.
* Knowledge of firsthand usage of an assistive technology by trying different operating systems and settings.
* Knowledge of firsthand usage of different adaptive strategies such as changing fonts or colors and applying custom style sheets.

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* **Presentational**: Elaborate on the most well-known assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that exist today: screen readers, screen magnifiers; captions, audio descriptions, braille, etc.
* **Demonstrations:** - Have experienced assistive technology users demonstrating the tools first. Ask them to use already accessible contents so that students can perceive the advantages of developing and designing in an accessible way.

#### Suggested activities 

Encourage students to try using assistive technologies built into their own computers / mobile phones. Ask them to perform tasks such as looking for information in a particular website or a mobile application.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write some lines on how a particular assistive tool is used. Encourage them to focus on all the aspects of such tool, such as shortcuts used or additional settings they might have needed to use for an optimal performance of the tool

#### Suggested teaching materials

* [Tools and Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques)
* [Web Accessibility Perspectives (Videos)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/)

### Lesson 4: Principles of inclusive design

{% include excol.html type="middle" %} 

Explain the overlapping accessibility needs of different users, such as "reading aloud" functionality benefiting people not seeing the screen and people with some forms of dyslexia. Explain that people could have combinations of disabilities, such as auditory and visual disabilities, especially with growing age. In particular, emphasize that people have very individual combinations of accessibility needs and preferences.

#### Learning outcomes

* Knowledge on the overlapping needs of people with disabilities.
* Understanding that people may have different types of disabilities at the same time.
* Understanding that people may have different ways to use technology even if they have the same type of disability.

{% endcomment %}

#### Suggested teaching methods 

* Presentational: Recap on the most common accessibility barriers and features already mentioned in previous lessons and explain that they might affect several groups of people with disabilities. Mention that the solutions for these problems might also be used by several people with disabilities. Examples of this solutions may be text-to-speech (which might be used both by people with vision impairments and also by people with cognitive disabilities). Mention that every individual uses the web in a different way regardless of whether or not they have a disability.

#### Suggested activities 

Engage students in a conversation about the different types of disabilities that exist. Encourage them to think and comment about distinct ways in which two people having the same type of disability could use technology differently.

#### Suggested homework 

Ask students to write some lines about the overlapping needs of people with disabilities that they can think of based on what they have just learned. Encourage them to elaborate on issues and repairs that might benefit more than one type of disability.

#### Suggested teaching materials

* [Tools and Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/)
* [Web Accessibility Perspective (Videos)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/)

{% include excol.html type="end" %} 

## Suggested Teaching Methods
**Experiential** &mdash; Provide opportunity for learners to experience real people and tools. If possible, invite people with disabilities or show videos. Accompanying explanation and guidance is still required.

## Suggested Teaching Materials

* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &mdash; provides stories of people with diverse disabilities using the Web; enumerates different types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces different types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/">Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)</a> &mdash; series of 10 videos, each of around 1 minute duration, that highlight different types of accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities and other users. For example, one video introduces colors with good contrast and how it benefits many people.
* <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing">(Work in progress) Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer</a> &mdash; provides references to resources to help users customize their particular web browser and computer setup, to improve their accessibility experience. It lists different types of settings and assistive tools that are available on different systems.

## Ideas for Assessment

* **Knowledge Questions** &mdash; Learners should be able to explain different types of accessibility features, such as colors with good contrast, types of barriers, and types of assistive tools and adaptive strategies. <br /><em>(Note: focus questions on functional aspects of accessibility rather than on medical conditions of people)</em>
* **Demonstrations** &mdash; Learners should be able to demonstrate what they have learned from exploring assistive tools and adaptive strategies, such as explaining different settings they found in their web browser.

## Notes

* **Ethical considerations** &mdash; Consider the appropriate ethical aspects when working with people (also when showing videos of people); for example, ensure consent, provide compensation, and avoid patronizing behavior.
* **clichés and myths** &mdash; Unfortunately there are clichés, myths, and even stigmatization of people with disabilities, which could be unintentionally reinforced. Experienced instructors are recommended.
* **Cultural aspects** &mdash; The definition of disability and the approach to accessibility varies between different cultures. This can impact the initial level of awareness and acceptance for the topic by learners.
