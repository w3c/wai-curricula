## Introduction
{:.no-display}

The objective of this unit are to:
* Provide students with an overview on the W3C accessibility standards and guidelines, as well as the principles of accessible design
* Introduce students to performing preliminary accessibility checks. 

Tip: Revise the inter-relation between components for accessibility which were introduced in the first units of this module. Relate this back to the stories of people with disabilities and highlight the broader benefits of these examples. Underline that accessibility encompasses many roles and responsibilities.

## Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* Define the scope of WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and WAI-ARIA and their relevance for accessibility
* Explain how W3C standards are developed and recognize their adoption by businesses internationally
* Describe different design and development requirements, and examples for each
* Define the terms Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR)
* Carry out preliminary accessibility evaluations of simple web pages

## Competences 

Learners

* Basic &mdash; Basic understanding of computers and the Web.

Instructors

### Topic: Standards and Guidelines

Use the [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview](#standards-guidelines) resource to introduce the scope of the W3C/WAI accessibility standards, which includes desktop and mobile websites and applications, authoring tools, web browsers, and some types of assistive tools. 

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners should be able to:
* List the current W3C web accessibility standards: WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and ARIA
* Explain the structure and goals of these standards: their principles, guidelines, requirements and the type of audience and components they address
* Explain the inter-relations between these standards with the web technologies and accessibility components such as HTML, authoring tools, user agents, and web applications
* Describe the public approach of the standards development process, with involvement from organizations of people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, and individuals interested

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* provide students with an outline of WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and ARIA.
* Explain their overall structure and sections and relate them with web technologies and components such as HTML, authoring tools, web browsers, assistive tools, and media players.
* Highlight that the standards are periodically updated. Updates respond to changes in technologies and components and also to changes in user needs and preferences.
* Refer to the uptake of W3C/WAI standards in different policies and standards.
* Explain that these W3C accessibility standards and guidelines are developed following an open consensus process, with involvement of representation of people with disabilities, industry, public bodies, research, and individual experts.
* Discuss with students the particular role of each of the standards mentioned and encourage them to reflect on which of them is more related to their particular environment.

**Tip:** Note that W3C Working Groups make document drafts available for public input. Everyone is encouraged to comment, to help include many perspectives thus ensure broad consensus around these standards.

#### Homework Ideas

Ask students to write a short paragraph for each of the standards defining its scope and overall structure and mentioning the web technologies and components they address.

### Topic: Principles of Accessible Design

Explain the terms Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR) based on how they are defined in WCAG. Refer to the [Accessibility Principles](#accessibility-principles) to obtain further information.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

* Understanding the terms "Perceivable", "Operable", "Understandable" and "Robust" in the context of WCAG
* Knowledge of the overall structure for each of the principles and guidelines
* Knowledge of some examples of accessibility requirements pertaining to each of the guidelines

{% comment %}

#### Duration

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Ideas

* Provide students with the definition of the four WCAG principles: "Perceivable", "Operable", "Understandable", and "Robust".
* Introduce the Guidelines defined by WCAG for each of these principles, and provide specific examples to help explain the meaning and relevance of each. For instance, refer to a specific requirement regarding the Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable. Emphasize how such requirements are essential for people with disabilities but also benefit all web users.
* Provide examples of some of the requirements, common problems they try to address, and some of the possible solutions.
* Engage students in a discussion about the four accessibility principles. Reflect with them on which of these principles is more related to their daily tasks or activities and how they could apply such principles in their daily job.

#### Homework Ideas

Ask students to write a short essay commenting on the four principles of web accessibility and their corresponding guidelines.

### Topic: First Checks for Web Accessibility

Use the [Easy Checks](#preliminary) resource as a reference to guide learners through preliminary checks for web accessibility on simple web pages. Show them how to identify page headings and their relative order, use by keyboard and other indicative checks. 

**NOTE:** this topic is not intended for students to perform full conformance evaluation, which requires technical skills and further accessibility knowledge. 

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### Learning Outcomes

* Identify potential accessibility issues such as keyboard navigation or heading order
* Relating the findings to the principles of WCAG they belong to

#### Duration.

Approximately 30-45 minutes.

{% endcomment %}

#### Teaching Activities Ideas

* Introduce learners to basic accessibility checks. Remember the importance of using several input and output methods such as mice, keyboards, and of using assistive tools such as screen readers, to check for possible accessibility issues.
* Ask learners to explore different types of websites and relate their findings to the accessibility principles and guidelines.
* Ask students to perform some accessibility checks in a web page of choice. Encourage them to use the keyboard and to use some assistive tool such as a screen reader to navigate and interact with the website.

#### Homework Ideas

Ask students to note down the results of their checks: what the specific problem is, which principle it belongs to, and how this issue might be resolved.

## Ideas for Assessment

* Learners should be able to explain the principles of web accessibility and enumerate different guidelines. Learners should be able to provide examples of web content, authoring tools, and user agents.
* Learners should be able to carry out first checks of accessibility principles on simple web pages. Learners can compare the accessibility of different websites or different pages on the same website.

## Suggested Teaching Methods

**Interactive** &mdash; To make many terms and definitions more tangible, ask learners to provide examples of web content, authoring tools, user agents, and of situations relating to the accessibility guidelines defined by WCAG.

## Notes

* **Technical jargon** &mdash; This teaching unit explores technical standards and resources, which include technical jargon. It will be important to explain terms and phrases in a more understandable way to most learners.
