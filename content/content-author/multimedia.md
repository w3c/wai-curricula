### Topic: Planning Audio and Video

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce different user needs for audio and video content. For example, for people who don't see the video and for people who don't hear the audio. For details, see [Understand the User Needs and Experiences of People with Disabilities ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/users-orgs/#understand-the-user-needs-and-experiences-of-people-with-disabilities).

Discuss best practices for audio and  video content, including clear audio and speech, sufficient contrast ratios, and speaker visibility. For details, see [Audio Content and Video Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/av-content/).

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* determine the required alternatives to multimedia content, including transcripts, description, captions, and sign language, based on:
  * audio and/or video
  * live or prerecorded
  * user needs
  * government regulations and other policy requirements
* explain the following accessibility best practices for audio and video content:
  * use clear audio, language, and speech to help users understand the content
  * ensure sufficient contrast ratio for video text to enhance text readability
  * provide audio with as low background as possible to help distinguish foreground from background sounds
  * consider speaker visibility (including for lip reading and sign language interpretation)
* ensure video content does not flash more than three times in any one second
* explain why non-substantive audio and video content does not need alternatives

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain that different government regulations and other policy requirements cover different user needs for audio and video content. Emphasize that some government regulations and policies may not cover all user needs depending on audience and context.
* Show examples of how people with disabilities use audio and video content. Discuss different types of accessibility requirements based on audio      and video content. These include transcripts, captions, description of visual information, and sign languages. Explain that these requirements vary depending on whether the content is live or pre-recorded. For references on the accessibility requirements for different types of audio and video content, see [Checklists for Audio and Video](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/planning/#checklist).
* Demonstrate accessibility best practices for creating audio and video content. These include clear speech, language, and audio, sufficient contrast ratio for videos, and speakers visibility. For details, see [Audio Content and Video Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/av-content/).
* Warn students that flashing and blinking content can create seizures and physical reactions for people. Content authors must ensure that there is no flashing content that can create seizures and physical reactions. For information on the accessibility requirements for flashing content, see [Understanding Success Criterion 2.3.1: Three Flashes or Below Threshold](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold).
* Present examples of inaccessible audio and video content. Discuss with students which alternatives they would include to make them accessible. Explain that it is best practice to explain why non-substantive audio and video content does not need alternatives. This helps users save time and avoid frustrations. For details, see [Inform users when not needed](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/planning/#none).
* Show examples of existing audio and video projects. Explain how to identify potential accessibility barriers to address. Discuss which accessibility best practices to include in the planning phase to minimize such barriers.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

* Practical &mdash; Give students a piece of audio and video content. Ask them to determine which alternatives to include and which not to include, as well as to explain why they decided not to include a specific alternative. Assess how students determine the required alternatives to audio and video content as well as how they explain why they decided not to include a specific alternative.
* Research &mdash; Ask students to research government regulations that may apply in their region for audio and video content. Then ask students to explain which user needs for audio and video content are covered and which are not covered in a specific government regulation or policy. Assess how students specify the user needs that specific government regulations and other policy requirements may not cover.
* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students to describe best practices for creating audio and video content. Assess how students describe best practices for creating audio and video content.

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Define captions as a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content. Explain that the terms "captions” and "subtitles” are used for the same thing in different regions of the world. See [Captions and Subtitles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/#captions-and-subtitles)
* Show examples of automatically-generated captions. Emphasize that automatically generated captions alone are not sufficient to meet the accessibility requirements. If relying on automatically-generated captions, content authors must ensure these captions are accurate and convey all the relevant information.
* Reflect with students on characteristics of quality captions, including relevant non-speech information as well as timestamps to identify when a person speaks.
* Show a piece of audio and video content. Discuss with students which information they would include in the captions.
* Introduce different types of file formats for captions, including WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks Format), SRT (SubRip Subtitle), and TTML (Timed Text Markup Language). Explain that it is more efficient to use specific software for creating captions, as the software can add the relevant timestamps. Sometimes content authors require help from specialized roles to produce accurate and quality captions.
* Show examples of how different media players and browsers display captions. Explain that some players let users determine how and where captions appear. Emphasize that specifying the position and appearance of captions requires collaboration between different team members, including designers, developers, and content authors.
