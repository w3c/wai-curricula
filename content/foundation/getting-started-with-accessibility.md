### Topic: Developing Policies and Statements

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce students to accessibility policies for organizations and accessibility statements for websites. See [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility](/planning/org-policies/) and [Developing an Accessibility Statement/](/planning/statements/).

* explain some current accessibility approaches from well-known organizations

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* If possible, bring in some examples of accessibility policies you are aware of or may have access to. Explain that they serve to document organizational commitments, to encourage implementation, and to define processes. If you do not have such documents, walk students through the different elements that are needed for an effective accessibility policy. Refer to [Accessibility Policies](/planning/org-policies/).
* Explore publicly-available accessibility statements and reflect with students on some of the aspects they include.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support your teaching:

* Report &mdash; Students draft an accessibility policy based on an organization of their choice. Assess how students define the scope of the policy and reference current standards.
* Presentation &mdash; Students draft an accessibility statement for a product of their choice and present it to their peers. Assess how students reflect on current status of the product and demonstrate commitment to accessibility.

### Topic: Roles and Responsibilities

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Introduce roles and responsibilities for accessibility. See [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document).

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how accessibility responsibilities are shared among different roles within the team
* describe some accessibility features and map them to specific roles

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Explain the different types of roles involved in implementing web accessibility. For reference, use [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document).
* Introduce the scope of their responsibilities throughout. Emphasize that sometimes a particular accessibility feature needs involvement from several roles.
* Introduce some accessibility features and specify which role(s) would be responsible for them. Explain that there might be only one role or several roles involved. Go through [Role-Based Decision Tree](https://w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role-Based_Decision_Tree).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Multiple Choice Questions &mdash; From a given set of product features, students assign their corresponding roles and responsibilities. For example, if an alternative text is required for an image, who would provide that text? Who would implement it?
