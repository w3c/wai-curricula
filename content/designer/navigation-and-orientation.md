[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to navigate and orient themselves in web pages and applications
* create designs that allow users to bypass blocks of repeated content, such as navigation links, header contents, or advertisements
* create designs that allow for multiple navigational mechanisms, such as menus, search boxes, breadcrumb trails, tables of contents, and sitemaps
* create designs that allow users to stop, adjust, and extend  existing time limits set by the content
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that navigational mechanisms can be used with the keyboard and other input devices

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Navigational Mechanisms

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support skipping blocks of repeated content providing at least one of the following:
  * a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area
  * a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block
  * links at the top of the page that go to each area of the content
  * an expandable and collapsible menu to make it easier for users to skip the menu
* create designs that support site maps to provide an overview of the entire website
* create designs that support breadcrumb trails to provide information about the user's location in a set of web pages
* create designs that support table of contents to give an overview of the whole website or document and to allow users to go to specific parts of the content

### Topic: Enough Time

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that allow users to turn off time limits, for example time limits in a form or times for which information is shown
* create designs that allow users to adjust existing time limits up to at least 10 times the original setting
* create designs that support extending existing time limits by warning the user at least 20 seconds before the time limit expires
* ensure content that auto scrolls can be paused and resumed from where it was left to allow users to better read and process content
