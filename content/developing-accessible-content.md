## Introduction
{:.no-display}

This curriculum focuses on markup and coding techniques. It is primarily designed for teaching front-end developers. Guidance on how to include these techniques in a framework or authoring tool is out-of-scope for this specific curriculum.

This curriculum can be combined with other curricula for teaching designers, content authors, and other roles.

This curriculum guides the creation of courses that:

* explain key terms for developers
* demonstrate how accessible coding helps people with disabilities use the Web
* provide markup and coding techniques around:
  * page structure
  * navigation
  * images and graphics
  * tables
  * forms
  * custom widgets
