## Topics to Teach

Optional topics to achieve the learning outcomes.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Simple Tables

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Define simple tables as those which contain one row or column header. Explain use of HTML elements to mark up tables, table headers, and table cells. Explain that table markup is used by text-to-speech technologies to help people orient and navigate tables.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain what simple tables mean in the context of web accessibility
* mark up tables using the HTML element `table`
* mark up and identify table headers using the HTML element `th`
* mark up and identify table data cells using the HTML element `td`
* explain how table markup allows text-to-speech technologies to associate information in header and data cells
* explain how table markup allows tables to be displayed using custom style sheets or different screen sizes

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Define simple tables as those which contain one row or column header. Explain that speech and mainstream technologies can associate information in the header and data cells if they are marked up appropriately. Examples of simple tables are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Tables with one header](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/one-header/).
* Show examples of use of the HTML elements `table`, `th`, and `td`. Explain that `table` is used to mark up the table layer, `th` is used to code header cells, and `td` is used to code data cells. For examples of how to mark up a simple table, refer to technique [H51: Using table markup to present tabular data](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H51).
* Demonstrate use of voice commands, keystrokes, or gestures provided by speech and mainstream technologies to navigate web pages through tables, and to move between cells in a table. Explore advanced functionality that some tools provide, such as presenting all tables in a list where users can select the table they are interested in. Examples of how people with disabilities interact with the web are provided in [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/).
* Provide examples of alternative renderings for tables, such as splitting the table into several lists, or showing only parts of the table in a mobile viewport.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are asked which HTML elements are needed to mark up a simple table structure. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements `table`, `th`, and `td`.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a simple table and are asked to identify its headers and code them using the `th` element. Assess students' understanding of the `th` element.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Complex Tables

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Define complex tables as those which contain multiple row and column headers. Explain use of additional techniques to convey structure and layout for complex tables, as well as to provide functionality that allows to sort data in a table. For example, the HTML elements `colgroup`, the attributes `scope` and `headers`, and the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-sort`.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain what complex tables mean in the context of web accessibility
* mark up and identify the direction of the headers using the HTML attribute `scope`
* mark up and identify headers that span several columns using the HTML elements `col` and `colgroup`
* mark up and identify headers that span multiple rows using the HTML element `tbody`
* code irregular headers for cells using the attribute `headers`
* mark up headers that allow for data sorting using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-sort=ascending, descending, other`, or `none`
* code additional functionality that allows to sort data using different input methods

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Explain that complex tables have column or row headers that span through several columns or rows. Indicate that assistive technologies may not interpret the direction and scope of such headers, so it is necessary to explicitly associate header cells and data cells.
* Demonstrate use of the HTML attribute `scope` and its values `row` and `column` to code the direction of the headers. Examples of how to use the HTML attribute `scope` are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Tables with two headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/two-headers/).
* Show examples of headers that span multiple rows or columns. Explain how to code them using the HTML elements `col`, `colgroup`, `thead` and `tbody`, as well as the attributes `colspan`, `rowspan`, and `rowgroup`. Examples of how to code headers that span several rows or columns are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Tables with irregular headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/irregular/).
* Show examples of uses of the `headers` attribute together with unique identifiers to associate more than two headers that relate to the same data cell. Explain that the identifiers of the corresponding header cells need to be separated by spaces in the value of the attribute `headers`. Examples of how to use the `headers` attribute are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Tables with multi-level headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/multi-level/).
* Show examples of sortable tables. Explain that the component that allows to sort the data is usually coded as a button so that it can be used with different input methods. Emphasize that additional feedback may need to be provided based on the support for the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-sort`, so that users are aware of how data is currently sorted. Examples of how to provide sortable tables are provided in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [Data grid example 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/grid/dataGrids.html).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short answer questions &mdash; Students are asked how table headers that span several rows or columns are coded in HTML. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements to code multiple row or column headers.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a table containing headers that span several columns or rows and are asked to code them. Assess how students use the HTML elements `th`, `col`, `tbody`, and the attribute `scope` to indicate the scope of the table headers and convey their direction.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with an irregular table and are asked to code its headers using the attribute `headers`. Assess how students use the attribute `headers` and its corresponding identifiers in data cells.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a sortable table and are asked to code it. Assess students' knowledge about how to use `aria-sort` and functionality that allows to sort data using different input methods.

### Topic: Table Summaries and Descriptions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML elements and WAI-ARIA attributes to provide information about the purpose of a table. Mention that providing descriptions for a table is a shared responsibility among different team members: content authors, designers, and developers.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code additional information to understand the structure and layout of the table using:
  * the HTML element `caption`
  * the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`
  * the HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption`
  * the HTML attribute `summary`
* summarize related requirements for authors to write meaningful table summaries and descriptions

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of use of the HTML element `caption` to provide descriptions for the purpose of a table. Mention that it needs to be the first child of the element `table` and that its contents are visible for all users by default. Examples of how to use the element `caption` are provided in technique [H39: Using caption elements to associate data table captions with data tables](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39).
* Explain use of methods to provide further details about the structure and contents of a table. For example, the HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption`, and the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`. Explain that the element `table` needs to be wrapped by the element `figure`, and that the element `figcaption` containing the text needs to be the first child of the element `figure`. Examples of how to code a table summary are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Caption and summary](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/caption-summary/).
* Explain use of the attribute `summary` to provide people using screen reader with detailed information about the structure of complex tables. Emphasize that it is obsolete according to the HTML5 specification, thus its use is only advisable for fallback purposes. Examples of how to use the attribute `summary` are provided in technique [H73: Using the summary attribute of the table element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H73).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a table and are asked to provide mechanisms for authors to add a short text to describe its purpose. Assess students' understanding of the `caption` element to describe the purpose of a table.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a complex table and are asked to include mechanisms for authors to provide extended details about its contents and overall structure. Assess students' knowledge of HTML elements and attributes to provide table summaries.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Students are directed to a web page where there are several tables and are asked to explore them using an accessibility evaluation extension. Then they are asked how many tables they have found and which their headers are. Assess how students analyze if a table is coded appropriately to reflect its structure.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students add tables to the website they are building. Assess how students code table headers and table cells, as well as how they provide a table caption and additional descriptions for tables.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a table with neither visual nor programmatic headers. Then they are asked to figure them out and decide if the table could be considered simple or complex. Assess how students identify table headers and distinguish between simple and complex tables.
