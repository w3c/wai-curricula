### Topic: Menu Structure

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Explain use of HTML elements to convey the menu structure.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* mark up menus using headings and/or the HTML element `nav`
* group items of the same menu using the HTML elements `ul`, `ol`, and `li`
* code menu items using the HTML element `a` and the attribute `href`
* label menu items using link text, graphics with their corresponding alternative text, and/or the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
* describe different types of menus such as vertical, horizontal, breadcrumb trails, or application menus

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of the HTML5 element `nav` to mark up a region as navigational. An example of how to use this element is provided in the WAI tutorials on [Identify menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#identify-menus).
* Refer back to the HTML elements `ul`, `ol`, and `li` taught in the previous module. Explain that they serve to structure and organize lists and list items. Examples on how to use these elements within a menu structure are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Menu representation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#menu-representation).
* Provide examples of labels for menu items. Mention that these labels can be either text or graphics with their corresponding alternative texts within the HTML element `a`. Emphasize that users with cognitive disabilities and screen reader users rely on them to identify the purpose of each of the menu items. For examples on how to provide descriptive link texts, see technique [G91: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G91.html).

### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Show examples of different types of menus, such as navigational, application, or breadcrumb trails. Explain that they need to be coded so that they are placed in the expected position within the page. Mention that menu location is a shared responsibility among different team members: content authors, designers, and developers. Examples of the expected positions of menus within the page are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Location](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/styling/#location).
* Introduce the different states that a menu item can have, such as hover, focus, current, active, or visited. Explain how to code these states so that they are perceived by all users. Examples on how to code these states are provided in the WAI tutorials, [Menu Items](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/styling/#menu-items).
* Show examples of different layouts for menus. Explain that menus should adapt to different text sizes users may choose. Mention that menus should have enough space so that they can be operated by all users. Considerations about readability and size of menu items are provided in the WAI tutorials, [General considerations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/styling/#general-considerations).

### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment.

* Practice &mdash; Students are presented with different types of menus and are asked to code them so that they are placed where expected. Assess students knowledge of the menu location within web pages.

* mark up visible or hidden states of menu items using text in their labels or the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-expanded`

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Show examples of menus that contain submenu items. Explain that the layer with the submenu items needs to be coded as a nested list, and that each of the submenu items need to be coded as a list item. An example of the structure of menu and submenu items is provided in the WAI tutorials on [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).
* Explain use of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-haspopup` to mark up the presence of submenu items. Indicate that this attribute should be present in the original HTML markup. An example of how to use the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-haspopup` is provided in the WAI tutorials on [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).
* Show examples of different ways to interact with fly-out menus, such as using the mouse or the keyboard. Examples on how to make functionality of fly-out menus available to all users are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Fly-Out functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#fly-out-functionality). 
* Explain that the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-expanded` conveys if the submenu items are visible or hidden. Explain that the attribute needs to be present in the original HTML markup. Examples of how to use the `aria-expanded` attribute are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus).

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

* code additional functionality so that application menus can be operated with the keyboard

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes.

* Show examples of different application menus. Emphasize that these types of menus are used when desktop functionality needs to be recreated and are not advised for navigational menu purposes. Explain that additional markup is necessary for assistive technologies to render these menus adequately. Examples of how to code application menus are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Additional markup](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/application-menus/#additional-markup).
* Show examples of how an application menu is operated using the keyboard.
