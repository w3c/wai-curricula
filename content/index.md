## Usage Guidance

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Different courses, training, and certification programs can combine modules from across all curricula. For example, teaching accessibility to computer science students likely involves modules from the introductory, developer, and designer curricula. On the other hand, assessing the accessibility knowledge of front-end developers will primarily involve modules from the developer curriculum. This resource does not prescribe specific combinations and order of modules for different programs. It also does not prescribe the duration or effort associated with each. It provides a reference for the learning outcomes on a modular level.

### Involve People with Disabilities

One of the most effective ways to learn and teach accessibility is by involving people with disabilities. This includes inviting people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact on the Web, the accessibility features they rely on, and challenges they sometimes encounter. If you cannot invite people with disabilities, maybe you can find suitable videos instead. Yet make sure to guide your students through the process to avoid perpetuating existing misunderstandings. For guidance on working with people with disabilities, ethical considerations, and cautions, refer to [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility](/planning/involving-users/).

### Communicate the Impact

Often teachings focus too much on the *how* and insufficiently on the *why*. Yet understanding the motivations for accessibility is essential to ensuring solutions that are usable in practice. Good practice for courses, training, and certification programs is to ensure that students understand the impact of accessibility barriers and features on people with disabilities. This includes how the learning outcomes, the teaching methods, and knowledge assessments are designed. For example, students should not only know the different ways to provide text alternatives for images. They should also know in which situations each method is more appropriate from the perspective of the user.

### Embrace Universal Design

Avoid inadvertent prioritizing of one perceived group over another. The accessibility requirements for people with disabilities overlap without clear boundaries. For example, captions support people who are deaf and hard of hearing as well as people with some forms of cognitive and learning disabilities. Good practice for courses, training, and certification programs is ensure that students understand the concepts of universal design to create accessible and inclusive experiences for everyone. For guidance on cross-disability aspects, refer to [How people with disabilities use the Web](/people-use-web).

### Make it Accessible

Good practice is to ensure that courses, training, and certification programs are accessible. This includes all presentations, teaching materials, exercises, assessments, and other student interactions. For example, ensure that the online learning platform, the classroom, computer lab, or training venue are accessible. Ensure that, for example, captioning, sign-language interpretation, and large-print formats are provided when needed. Also ensure that instructors read aloud what is on the screen and describe any visual information through audio. For more guidance, refer to [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).

## Accreditation and Certification

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Different types of attestation are commonly issued following courses, training, and assessments. This includes:

* **Attestation of attendance**, for example acknowledging that students attended classes
* **Attestation of completion**, for example acknowledging that students completed assignments
* **Attestation of assessment**, for example acknowledging that students acquired skills

Such attestation could be recognized by formal authorities or recognized by other entities, in which case they are commonly referred to as certification. For example, a universal design course may be formally accredited by a university, and a web design training may be accredited by an industry association. Such accreditation could be local, national, regional, or international depending on the recognition of the authority or entity itself.

This resource does not prescribe or favor any particular type of accreditation and certification scheme. Currently W3C only endorses the free online course <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/12/free-online-course-introduction-to-web-accessibility/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a>.
