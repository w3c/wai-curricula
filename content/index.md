## Usage Guidance

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Different courses, training, and certification programs can combine modules from across all curricula. For example, teaching accessibility to computer science students likely involves modules from the introductory, developer, and designer curricula. On the other hand, assesing the accessibility knowledge of front-end developers will primarily involve modules from the developer curriculum. This resource does not prescribe specific combinations and order of modules for different programs. It also does not prescribe the duration or effort associated with each. It provides a reference for the learning outcomes on a modular level.

### Involve People with Disabilities

One of the most effective ways to learn and teach accessibility is by involving people with disabilities. This includes inviting people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to interact on the Web, the accessibility features they rely on, and challenges they sometimes encounter. If you cannot invite people with disabilities, maybe you can find suitable videos instead. Yet make sure to guide your students through the process to avoid perpetuating existing misunderstandings. [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/involving-users/) provides guidance on working with people with disabilities ethical considerations and cautions.

### Communicate the Impact

Often teachings focus too much on the *how* and insufficiently on the *why*. Yet understanding the motivations for accessibility is essential to ensuring solutions that are usable in practice. Good courses, training, and certification programs ensure that students understand the impact of accessibility barriers and features on people with disabilities. This includes how the learning outcomes, the teaching methods, and knowledge assesments are designed. For example, students should not only know the different ways to provide text alternatives for images but also know in which situations each method is more appropriate from the perspective of the user.

### Embrace Universal Design

Avoid inadvertent prioritizing of one perceived group over another. The accessibility requirements for people with disabilities overlap without clear boundaries. For example, captions support people who are deaf and hard of hearing as well as people with some forms of cognitive and learning disabilities. Good courses, training, and certification programs ensure that students understand the concepts of universal design to create accessible and inclusive experiences for everyone. [How people with disabilities use the Web](/people-use-web) provides more guidance on cross-disability aspects.

### Make it Accessible

Good courses, training, and certification programs are accessible. This includes all presentations, teaching materials, exercises, assessments, and other student interactions. For example, ensure that the online learning platform, the classroom, computer lab, or training venue are accessible. Ensure that, for example, captioning, sign-language interpretation, and large-print formats are provided when needed. Also ensure that instructors read alound what is on the screen and describe any visual information through audio. More guidance is provided in [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).

## Types of Accreditation

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Some types of certification that may be issued following a course, training, or assessment include:

* **Certification of attendance**, for example that students attended the classes
* **Certification of completion**, for example that students completed the assignments
* **Certification of assessment**, for example that students acquired the skills

Each of these types of certification could be accredited by formal authorities or recognized by other entities. For example, a universal design course may be formally accredited by a university and a web design training may be recognized by an industry association. This could be local, national, regional, or international depending on the recognition of the authority or entity itself.

This resource does not prescribe or favor any particular type of certification and accreditation scheme.
